# quicksharper
CLI helper to quickly create new .NET projects

## Installation
- Gitclone the repository
- Build it (a debug binary can be found in /bin/Debug) with "dotnet build"
- Add a shortcut of "quicksharper.exe" to your personal folder (ex.: C:\Users\bruno)

## Usage
- Open the CMD
- Execute "quicksharper.exe.lnk"

## Why?
I do not want to use Visual Studio for simple projects like these, and I know people who have weak PCs who can't run VS either. The problem is: it takes too much time to create a dotnet project with the Windows cmd. That's why I've created this CLI helper.
